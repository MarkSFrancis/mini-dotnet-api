# Mini dotnet API

Testing out the new [minimal APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/minimal-apis?view=aspnetcore-6.0#aspnet-core-middleware) from aspnetcore.

These APIs allow for a totally different approach than MVC, allowing for much more express-like routing, including nested routes, and configuration over convention.

This project aims to demo some of that functionality, leaning aggressively into pure functions and functional programming paradigms, instead of the traditional OOP of aspnetcore applications.
